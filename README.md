#### Motivation

**The idea behind this project is to explore and understand if the existence and rise of Airbnb has any correlation with the crime rates in New York City.** <br>


We came across articles about the increase in crimes in NYC in Q1 of 2022 which led to the article “Why do some crimes increase when Airbnbs come to town?” 

We found this particularly interesting because we saw the potential of using data to see if a short-term vacation rental company has anything to do with the crime rates in a major city such as NYC and hence, that became our hypothesis for this project.
